How to install any prerequisites, build your program, and run our application.
We made our project using java only so you can run our project by exporting the zip file into 
your desired destination. You can then open it using any IDE used for java files or you can
use the command prompt to run it. To run it on the command prompt you simply open up the command prompt
and change directories until you get to the directory of the project and then you go into the src directory.
Once you're in the src directory you can use the command "javac *.java" to compile all of the java files. 
After compiling the java files you can run the main class by using the command "java chat" which will give you a random port
number. However if you run it as "java chat 4000" for example, that will run the main class with the port number of 4000.
